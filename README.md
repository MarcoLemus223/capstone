This project is my take on a magic 8 ball, I have get request for my preset answers in my code so when you press enter or click on the button you will get any one of those preset answers. I have a post request so when you type a question in it will go into an empty array and you will get an answer back that way as well. For the alert that shows up on the page I created a function to display the alert on the page insted of the alert showing up on the top. I also added in a wiki link at the top right if any of the users are curious about the 8 ball and wanted to learn more about it.
